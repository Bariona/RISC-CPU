:dart:goal: Fetch instruction ... 

- pc reg: program counter

- ICache (i.e. Instruction Queue):

  size: 256 entries (7:0) 

  Since it's a I`$`, using the knowledge acquired in *Arch*, we use Direct Map mechanism for it:

  - components: index, valid_bit, value



## Predictor



1. reset = 1: clear the state

2. ready = 0: postpone the action
